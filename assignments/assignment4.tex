	%%%%%%   question 1
	%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
	\section*{Solution of question 2}
	1. \textbf{At what learning rate does the method converge?}\\
	2. \textbf{What is the optimal learning rate?}\\

	%%%%%%   question 2
	%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
	\section*{Solution of question 4}
	1. \textbf{What do you expect to see (stochastic gradient vs. Newton) before running the experiment?}\\
	The Newton method will converge faster than stochastic gradient descent.\\
	2. \textbf{Which method takes less time to compute one step?}\\
	Stochastic gradient descent takes less time per step, since no Hessian matrix will be calcualted.\\
	3. \textbf{Which method requires fewer steps to converge?}\\
	The newton mathd costs less steps to converge\\
	4. \textbf{Which method achieves better accuracy?}\\
	Stochastic gradient descent achieves better accuracy. The result of Newton method will end up the places around the optimal result.\\

	%%%%%%   question 3, sub question (a)
	%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
	\section*{Solution of question 6}
	1. \textbf{Which method is more computationally efficient?}\\
	The gaussian discriminant analysis achieves better efficiency.\\
	2. \textbf{Which method achieves the best accuracy?}\\
	From the curves showed by logistic regression and gaussian discriminant analysis, GDA has better performance.\\
